    "description": "The Geisel House is full of thoughtful observers and precise planners. We’re analytical, introspective visionaries — we want to know how things work and why they matter. Whether it’s a system, a theory, or a puzzle, we approach it with sharp logic and relentless curiosity. We pride ourselves in our high standards for competence, strategic thinking that turns ideas into actions, and unmatched focus. Though we enjoy thinking deeply by ourselves, we love working with fellow scholars even more — why have a breakthrough in silence, when we could do it in half the time with another equally brilliant mind? You can find us in the depths of Geisel Library with our headphones in and notebooks out, leaning over to share our thoughts with friends when we have an insight."

    "description": "Hi there, fellow bandit! Are you ready to have some fun? We Raccoons are the sparks of joy, teeming with boundless creativity and energy, with a serious love for new experiences. We’re always on the lookout for new friends, wild projects, and the next spontaneous adventure. We often bring the energy to the room — and the ideas, too. We thrive the most when we’re surrounded by possibility, people, and chaos. We pride ourselves on our optimism, creative sparks, and social instincts — you won’t find anyone as capable of bringing together a team as us! You can find us in the middle of Price Center or at MOMs, juggling three projects, brainstorming a dozen ideas, and learning hands-on all before breakfast."

    "description": "Sun Gods are natural-born leaders, fueled by passion, courage, and determination. We’re here to make things happen, whether that’s starting a new tradition or leading a team to the finish line. We pride ourselves on our drive and clarity — we don’t just have a vision, we pursue it until perfection. Beyond bringing out the best in ourselves, we look for the best in others, too. We know how to appreciate those who can match our enthusiasm and exhibit spectacular performance. You can find us in DIB, CSE, SME, or by Sun God, looking to start something new!"

    "description": "Here at the Triton House, we pride ourselves on our ability to listen deeply, emphasize naturally, and remain grounded even in the most dire of situations. We know there’s no need to rush to the finish line, because it’s only through careful examination that we can achieve thorough understanding and excellent work. Don’t mistake our conscientious support for passiveness, however — once we finish analyzing a task, we can use all of our abilities and resources to quickly and successfully complete it. No matter what, where, or who we’re working with, we’ll be the first to find our footing. You can find us in Birch Aquarium, at a quiet corner on the beach, or sitting on the steps of Price Center next to King Triton, thinking about our next project!"
